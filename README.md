# üß† NeuroMood

A neural network that classifies EEG brainwave signals into emotional states: **Positive**, **Negative**, and **Neutral**.

This project was built as my first neural network using **PyTorch**, inspired by the digit recognition task in Michael Nielsen's "Neural Networks and Deep Learning", but applied to a more unique and real-world dataset: EEG emotion signals.

## üìä Dataset (Kaggle)

This project uses the [EEG Signals for Emotion Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadkhalil01/eeg-signals-emotion-classification) dataset from Kaggle.

It contains EEG features extracted from brainwave signals while subjects experienced different emotions. The task is to classify the emotional state into:

- `"POSITIVE"`
- `"NEGATIVE"`
- `"NEUTRAL"`

### üìÅ Dataset Details

- CSV format with **2548 numerical features per row**
- One label column indicating the emotion
- Well-balanced between the 3 classes

### ‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing

- `LabelEncoder` used to convert string labels to integer class indices
- Features scaled using `StandardScaler` to improve neural network training
- Data converted into PyTorch tensors and loaded using `DataLoader` for batching

## üß† Model Architecture

The model is a simple fully connected feedforward neural network built using PyTorch:

```python
nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(2548, 128),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(128, 64),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(64, 3)
)

```
üìà Results
‚úÖ Final Test Accuracy: ~98%
After training on the EEG dataset for 10 epochs with scaled features, the model achieved extremely high performance on the test set.

        NEU      0  143    0
        POS      5    1  136
(NEG = Negative, NEU = Neutral, POS = Positive)

‚úÖ NEUTRAL class was predicted perfectly.

‚úÖ Very low misclassifications: just 9 out of 427 samples total.
